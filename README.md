## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerisation. Containerisation is a lightweight form of virtualisation that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a standardised unit called a container. Containers are isolated and encapsulated environments that can run on any operating system or cloud infrastructure without requiring the installation of additional software or dependencies.

With Docker, you can create and manage containers that encapsulate all the necessary components of an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. These containers are portable and can be easily moved across different environments, such as development, testing, and production, ensuring consistency and reducing the "works on my machine" problem.

Docker key components:

- Docker Image: An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application.

- Docker Container: A container is a running instance of an image. It provides an isolated and secure environment for executing an application. Multiple containers can run simultaneously on a single host, each with its own resources.

- Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, the application code, dependencies, and configurations required to create the image.

- Docker Registry: A registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry, where you can find a wide range of pre-built images. You can also set up private registries to store and distribute your own images.

- Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. It allows you to specify the configuration of multiple services, their dependencies, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file, making it easier to manage complex applications.
